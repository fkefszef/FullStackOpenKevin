1. Install node and hope it works fine right of the bat. If it doesn't, question your life choices and then go to step 2
2. Open powershell and paste in:
	Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
2.1. Just agree by typing 'y'.
3. Open Profile Environment Variables by just searching them up, edit Path and add new rule containing path to '(node folder)/node_modules/npm':
	D:\nodejs\node_modules\npm
Done!.. or should be..
thats why! 
3.1. Open up visual studio code, open new terminal, type in npm - if you get error then its fucked up :)
sooo, typical way of solving shit is turning off and back on - try it, if it still throws error then bro better start looking for a different or ask ChatGPT but usualy it doesn't help.
